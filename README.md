# ASLConnect

ASLConnect is a full-stack web application designed for real-time American Sign Language (ASL) learning and gesture translation. The system features interactive ASL lessons, text-to-ASL conversion, and live ASL-to-text recognition powered by a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on the Sign Language MNIST dataset. Using PyTorch, TorchVision, and OpenCV, the model achieves 90% accuracy. The platform includes real-time hand tracking with MediaPipe and live video inference via Flask APIs. Built with Angular and hosted on Firebase, ASLConnect supports up to 5,000 users with real-time content delivery and secure, role-based admin access.
